Q: Explain how the arrow keys change the cursor position.

According to implementation of the kbdgetc() from kbd.c, and consoleintr() from
console.c, xv6 operating system does not have any mechanism for handling the
KEY_UP, KEY_DN, KEY_LF, and KEY_RT (although they gived the arrow keys names
in kbd.h). Each time when arrow key pressed, xv6 directly print it to the
console.c via the calls of consputc(). These special characters pass through
qemu without any additional actions. And the (gnome) terminal emulator
prints these special characters, intepreting as arrow moving commands. The
operating system does not know the cursor moves.
