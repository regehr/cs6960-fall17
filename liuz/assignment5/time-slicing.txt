Proof

At line 23 of the 'main.c', the main function calls the 'lapicinit()'
function. This function is implemented in the 'lapic.c' and initialize the
interrupt controller as the operating system boots. During the interrupt
initialization, Line 67-69 sets a timer and automatically triggers an interrupt
at a constant time interval.

The 'trap' function in 'trap.c' is called whenever an interrupt is fired. As
line 105-107 shows, the trap function checks the source of trap and calles the
'yield' function each time when the the process is 'RUNNING' and the timer
interrupt fires. The 'yield' function is implemented in 'proc.c' and it calles
the scheduler. Thus that xv6 always pre-empts processes to schedule other
ones. Xv6 is a time-slicing operating system.
