In class, we looked at the code doing I/O for xv6. xv6 clearly doesn't
treat the arrow keys as special characters. It just prints to the console.
But the terminal emulator of the host system interprets the arrow keys
and moves the cursor accordingly. The xv6 is completely unaware of this
position change as it considered them just as any other character.
