Why can a long chain of commands such as "ls | wc | wc | wc ..." deadlock?

It doesn't, but some implementation peculiarities can make it appear as if it did.

The xv6 shell only reads commands of up to 100 characters long. Any longer and the
line will get broken into two separate commands.

Additionally, trailing pipe operators "|" cause the shell to effectively redirect
output into a no-op command, causing nothing to be printed.

So when you run a "ls | wc | wc ..." chain like that mentioned above, the shell breaks
the chain into two commands, "ls | wc | ... | wc |", which prints nothing, and 
"wc | wc | ...", which blocks reading standard in. This makes it appear as if the system is deadlocked,
when in fact the final "wc" is just reading standard input indefinitely.
